# Simple python/php auth
 this is a auth system use for python tools with hwid and time lock making it hard to get around
 Instructions: rename the php file to the name of your tool and upload it to main directory of a host like 000webhost is fine
 then put the function into yout python code and update the url to the directory of your php on the 000webhost users and hwid need to be added manually as im to lazy to make it add the hwid on its own
 in the future will update just to busy atm
 also dont forgot to add your salt in both the php and python code both salts need to be the same
